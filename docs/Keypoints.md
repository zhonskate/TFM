# Keypoints

In this documents we are gonna answer simple questions asked about each technology. These questions refer to some key aspects that we have to take into account in order to compare them. 

Those questions will be:

- **Supported Runtimes:** Either a list of the runtimes/languages available or if it's possible to have custom runtimes. In the latest case specify the requisites to create your own runtimes.

- **Code and depencences:** Specify the way to load the code and its dependences.

- **Function requisites:** What is a function in this context? What elements are compulsory for the function to work and what constraints do they have. Focus on I/O.

- **Deployment method:** Does it deploy in K8s, Docker or where?

- **Autoscaling policies:** Are configurable? Which part of the stack takes care of them? Is scale-to-zero possible? Focus on container reusal and *warmification*.

- **Triggers:** Supported types, hor are they invoked, etc.

- **Multi-tenancy:** Is multi-tenancy supported? In which way?

- **Platform security:** How is the platform secured agaist authentication and authorization threats.

- **Isolation:** Who provides execution isolation? Is it enough?
